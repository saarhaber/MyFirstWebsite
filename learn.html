<p> Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page.
  Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the
  articles (or other pages) that have been added to that particular
  category. There may also be a section listing the subcategories
  of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to
  organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation. </p>
