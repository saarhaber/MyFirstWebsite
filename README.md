This is the first website I have ever made.
The goal of making it is exploring more about html, css and js.

I am making it from scratch just by watching tutorials and learning JavaScript online.
Using sources such as SoloLearn, FreeCodeCamp and YouTube videos.

Last Update:
03/09/19: Video capturing (snapping a picture) is now available on the site!

03/28/19: made proggress on freecodecamp
